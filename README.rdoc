This is a mostly static site build using rails. I have also used twitter bootstrap for css and javascript help. It is hosted on heroku.

If you happen to actually read this, provide feedback on the site if you would.

Thanks,

I have a link to the site, and currently it is set to a heroku url. 

I will get the real url up and running when I am 100% finished.

This site is cool.
